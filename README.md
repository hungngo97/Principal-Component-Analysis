# Principal-Component-Analysis
This paper illustrates an overview of principal component analysis and dimensional reduction to perform better data analysis. This technique allows us to extract hidden features from large amount of data by analyzing variances among variables and linearly transform original data to a new orthogonal coordinate system to discover insights. This paper demonstrates an application of principal component analysis by detecting harmonic oscillation movement in a spring-mass system data. 
This paper gives a gentle introduction to principle component analysis and dimensionality reduction in general. 
In this era of big data and machine learning, it is extremely vital to perform data mining and extract important 
features out of high dimensional data. The more noise we can omit, the better our analysis can enhance through
either computation resources saving and even easier intuitive understanding of data with less variables. Intuitively,
principal component analysis is a technique to project correlated and high dimensional data to another orthogonal 
coordinate system that reduces the correlation between variables. This new perspective on the original data can extract
new features and help us decide which feature we can safely omit. This paper also introduces one application of 
principal component analysis by feature detection through analyzing spring mass system data and discovering hidden 
dynamics that is learned through data. This application illustrates how we can learn from data without even knowing 
the governing equations under systems. A breadth of technological fields can benefit from such an application of principal 
component analysis such as analyzing big dynamic system like turbulent fluid flow, and even as input to machine learning 
algorithms and neural networks.
